# Consistent-Hashing-Implementation
1. Design and implement a Consistent Hashing mechanism that: Distributes keys uniformly across nodes 
2. Minimizes key movement during node addition/removal 
3. Supports deterministic lookup 
4. Handles node rebalancing efficiently
5. Virtual Nodes creation and distribution
